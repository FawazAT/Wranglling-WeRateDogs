# Wranglling-WeRateDogs
Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.
Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
